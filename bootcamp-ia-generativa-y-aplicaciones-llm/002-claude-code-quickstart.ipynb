    "\n",
    "2. **Install Node.js:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   brew install node\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Or, Upgrade Node.js (if already installed via Homebrew):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   brew upgrade node\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify Version:**\n",

    "   ```bash\n",
    "   node -v\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "**Option 2: Using Node Version Manager (nvm)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to manage multiple Node versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install nvm:**\n",
    "\n",

    "   nvm use 18\n",
    "   nvm alias default 18\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "\n",
    "## Windows Users\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check Node.js Version\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```cmd\n",
    "   node -v\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   If the version is **v18.x.x or higher**, you're set.\n",
    "   If it says **'node' is not recognized** or the version is older, proceed to install or upgrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To Install or Upgrade to Node.js 18+ on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Install from Official Installer (Recommended)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the official Node.js download page:\n",
    "   👉 **[https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Download the **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version — which is often 18.x or newer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the installer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Follow the prompts (you can leave defaults).\n",
    "   * It will include **npm** (Node Package Manager) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After installation, check versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```cmd\n",
    "   node -v\n",
    "   npm -v\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Using Node Version Manager for Windows (nvm-windows)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps you manage multiple Node versions easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download nvm-windows from:\n",
    "   👉 **[https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the installer (nvm-setup.exe) and complete setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once installed, open **Command Prompt** and:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Install Node 18:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```cmd\n",
    "     nvm install 18\n",

    "\n",
    "     ```cmd\n",

    "## The claude.md file (similar to the .cursorrules file in Cursor)\n",
    "When you're using Claude Code, a **`CLAUDE.md`** file serves as a *persistent context/priming document* for your project. It gets automatically generated (when you run `/init`) and is recursively loaded based on where you're working in your repo—both from parent and child directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is `CLAUDE.md`?\n",
    "* **Context container**: It captures your project’s architecture, coding standards, helpful guidelines like build commands or linting workflows—everything Claude should know as it works.\n",
    "* **Automatically initialized**: Triggered via `claude` CLI with `/init`. Claude scans your repo, constructs the initial file, and you can then commit it.\n",
    "* **Context-aware loading**: Claude reads any `CLAUDE.md` in current or parent folders, and can even load multiple files hierarchically.\n",
    "* **Live-editable**: As your project evolves, you can refine it—add instructions, refactor standards, or insert slash-command definitions marked with `#`. Claude will incorporate updates on the next run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why it matters\n",
    "A well-crafted `CLAUDE.md` ensures Claude Code “knows”:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your codebase structure\n",
    "* Project conventions (e.g., React + Express, TypeScript settings)\n",
    "* Useful commands (build/lint/test)\n",
    "* Domain-specific terms or standards\n",
    "\n",
    "That way, you don’t have to re-explain context in each session. Instead, Claude generates better code autonomously—and its performance improves over time as the file evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary\n",
    "* `CLAUDE.md` = your **project's memory and instruction set** for Claude Code.\n",
    "* Auto-generated, customizable, and version-controlled.\n",
    "* Loaded hierarchically—so you can have different context at project or subfolder levels.\n",
    "* Crucial for getting consistent, accurate, context-aware results across coding sessions."
