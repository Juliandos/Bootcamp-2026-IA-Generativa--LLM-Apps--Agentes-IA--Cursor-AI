    "\n",
    "### Simple Todo App Storage Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Todo app, everything was stored in one place:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Todo App - Everything in Database\n",
    "class Todo(Base):\n",
    "    __tablename__ = \"todos\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n",
    "    name = Column(String)          # ← Todo text stored here\n",
    "    completed = Column(Boolean)    # ← Status stored here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Todo App Environment Variables\n",

    "# .env file for Todo app\n",

    "DATABASE_PORT=5432\n",
    "DATABASE_NAME=modern_todo_db\n",

    "## Part 2: What Changes - PDF App Dual Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Need Cloud Storage for Files\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem**: PDF files are:\n",
    "- **Large** (can be several MB each)\n",
    "- **Binary data** (not text like todo items)\n",
    "- **Need special handling** (upload, download, display)\n",
    "- **Expensive to store in database** (databases aren't optimized for large files)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution**: Split storage into two systems:\n",
    "1. **Database**: Stores metadata (filename, selected status, file URL)\n",
    "2. **AWS S3**: Stores the actual PDF files\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# PDF App - Dual Storage Model\n",

    "    selected = Column(Boolean) # ← Status stored in database\n",

    "1. **Architecture**: Single storage → Dual storage (database + cloud)\n",
    "2. **Dependencies**: Simple packages → AWS SDK + file handling\n",
    "3. **Configuration**: Database only → Database + cloud credentials  \n",
    "4. **Environment**: Local variables → Local + cloud service variables\n",
    "5. **Data Flow**: Direct storage → Two-step process\n",
    "6. **Costs**: Predictable → Variable based on usage\n",
    "7. **Complexity**: Simple → Multiple services to manage\n",

    "### Why These Changes Are Worth It:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Better Performance**: Files don't slow down your database  \n",
    "✅ **Lower Costs**: S3 is much cheaper for file storage  \n",
    "✅ **Better Scaling**: S3 handles millions of files automatically  \n",
    "✅ **Global Access**: CDN delivers files fast worldwide  \n",
    "✅ **Reliability**: AWS provides 99.999999999% durability  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
