    "Now it's time to add AI superpowers to your FastAPI backend! In this notebook, you'll learn how to integrate **LangChain** with your existing Todo API to create two powerful AI features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📝 Text Summarization**: A general-purpose AI endpoint for summarizing any text\n",
    "2. **🎭 Poem Generator**: Transform your todo items into creative poems using AI\n",
    "\n",
    "**The best part?** Your existing todo CRUD operations will continue working exactly as before - we're just adding new AI-powered endpoints!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 What We're Building\n",
    "\n",
    "**New API Endpoints:**\n",
    "- `POST /todos/summarize-text` - Summarize any text using AI\n",
    "- `POST /todos/write-poem/{id}` - Generate a poem from a specific todo\n",

    "### What We Need to Add\n",
    "\n",
    "Your existing Todo app already has most of what we need. We just need to add a few AI-specific packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Packages:**\n",
    "- `langchain==0.1.1` - Main LangChain library\n",
    "- `openai` - OpenAI API client (already included in LangChain)\n",
    "- Your existing packages stay exactly the same!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Navigate to Your Backend Directory**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd your-todo-app/backend\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Activate Your Virtual Environment**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# If using Poetry (modern todo app)\n",
    "poetry shell\n",
    "\n",
    "# If using venv (original todo app)\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux\n",
    "# OR\n",
    "venv\\Scripts\\activate     # Windows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Install LangChain**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# If using Poetry\n",
    "poetry add langchain==0.1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "# If using pip\n",
    "pip install langchain==0.1.1\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why This Specific LangChain Version?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using **LangChain 0.1.1** because:\n",
    "- ✅ **Stable and tested**: Known to work well with our patterns\n",
    "- ✅ **Simple imports**: Uses the classic `from langchain import` syntax\n",
    "- ✅ **Educational clarity**: Fewer abstractions to understand\n",
    "- ✅ **Consistent results**: Same behavior across all installations\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Important**: LangChain updates frequently and newer versions might have different syntax. Stick with 0.1.1 for this tutorial to avoid compatibility issues."

    "## Part 3: Understanding LangChain Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we write code, let's understand the LangChain building blocks we'll use:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. OpenAI LLM (Large Language Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain import OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an OpenAI instance\n",
    "llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters Explained:**\n",
    "- **`temperature=0`**: More focused, consistent responses (range: 0-1)\n",
    "  - `0` = very focused, predictable\n",
    "  - `1` = very creative, unpredictable\n",
    "  - `0.7` = balanced creativity (good for poems)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What This Does:**\n",
    "- Connects to OpenAI's API using your key\n",
    "- Uses GPT-3.5-turbo by default (fast and cost-effective)\n",
    "- Handles authentication automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. PromptTemplate\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain import PromptTemplate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a reusable prompt template\n",
    "prompt = PromptTemplate(\n",
    "    template=\"Write a summary of: {text}\",\n",
    "    input_variables=['text']\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use Templates?**\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Same prompt format every time\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Use with different inputs\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Change prompt in one place\n",
    "- **Testing**: Easy to test different prompt versions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Template Syntax:**\n",
    "- `{variable_name}` gets replaced with actual values\n",
    "- `input_variables` list must match template variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. LLMChain\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.chains import LLMChain\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combine LLM + Prompt into a chain\n",
    "chain = LLMChain(\n",
    "    llm=llm,\n",
    "    prompt=prompt\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the chain\n",
    "result = chain.run(text=\"Your input text here\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What LLMChain Does:**\n",
    "1. Takes your input variables\n",
    "2. Fills in the prompt template\n",
    "3. Sends the complete prompt to the LLM\n",
    "4. Returns the AI's response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Chains:**\n",
    "- **Clean code**: One line to run AI operations\n",
    "- **Error handling**: Built-in retry and error management\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: Can chain multiple operations together\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Easy to see what's being sent to AI"

    "\n",
    "**`@router.post(\"/write-poem/{id}\")`**\n",
    "- Creates: `POST /todos/write-poem/123`\n",
    "- `{id}` is a path parameter for the todo ID\n",
    "- Uses POST because it triggers AI processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**`id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)`**\n",
    "- `id: int` extracts todo ID from URL path\n",
    "- `db: Session` injects database connection (existing pattern)\n",
    "- Uses your existing `get_db()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database Integration:**\n",
    "- `todo = crud.read_todo(db, id)` uses your existing CRUD function\n",
    "- Follows your established patterns\n",
    "- No new database code needed!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling:**\n",
    "1. **Todo not found** → 404 error (standard REST pattern)\n",
    "2. **AI errors** → 500 error with helpful message\n",
    "3. **Re-raise HTTP exceptions** → Preserves proper error responses\n",

    "**AI Integration:**\n",
    "- `poem = write_poem_chain.run(text=todo.name)` uses todo content\n",
    "- Returns poem in consistent JSON format\n",

    "## Part 8: Testing the Poem Generation Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Make Sure You Have Todos\n",
    "\n",
    "Before testing poem generation, create a few todos using your existing API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open FastAPI Docs**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`\n",
    "2. **Use `POST /todos/`** to create test todos:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Todo 1:**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Study for math exam\",\n",
    "  \"completed\": false\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Todo 2:**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Finish painting project\",\n",
    "  \"completed\": false\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Todo 3:**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Buy groceries\",\n",
    "  \"completed\": false\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use `GET /todos/`** to see your todos and note their IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Test Poem Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Find Your New Endpoint**: `POST /todos/write-poem/{id}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test with ID 1:**\n",
    "1. Click \"Try it out\"\n",
    "2. Enter `1` for the `id` parameter\n",
    "3. Click \"Execute\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Response:**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"poem\": \"Numbers dance across the page,\\nFormulas waiting to be solved,\\nKnowledge grows with every stage,\\nAs mysteries get resolved.\\n\\nEquations hold the key to truth,\\nMath exam approaching near,\\nStudy hard and use your youth,\\nSuccess will soon appear!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Test Different Todo Content\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creative Task (Painting):**\n",
    "- Should generate artistic, colorful poems\n",
    "- Words about creativity, colors, art\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mundane Task (Groceries):**\n",
    "- Should create something fun from ordinary content\n",
    "- Shows AI's ability to find creativity in simple tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Academic Task (Study):**\n",
    "- Should generate motivational, focused poems\n",
    "- Educational and encouraging tone\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Test Error Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-existent Todo ID:**\n",
    "1. Try ID `999` (should not exist)\n",
    "2. Expected response:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"detail\": \"Todo not found\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Status code should be `404`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invalid ID Format:**\n",
    "1. Try ID `abc` (not a number)\n",
    "2. FastAPI should return validation error\n",
    "3. Shows built-in input validation working\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Verify Integration Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Success Checklist:**\n",
    "- Poem endpoint finds existing todos correctly\n",
    "- Generated poems relate to todo content\n",
    "- Error handling works for missing todos\n",
    "- Response format is consistent\n",
    "- Your existing todo CRUD still works perfectly\n",
    "- Both AI endpoints (summarize + poem) function\n",
    "\n",
    "**📊 Performance Notes:**\n",
    "- Poem generation takes 2-5 seconds (AI processing time)\n",
    "- Database lookup is instant (uses existing optimized queries)\n",
    "- Total response time is dominated by AI API call\n",
    "- This is normal and expected for AI features!"
