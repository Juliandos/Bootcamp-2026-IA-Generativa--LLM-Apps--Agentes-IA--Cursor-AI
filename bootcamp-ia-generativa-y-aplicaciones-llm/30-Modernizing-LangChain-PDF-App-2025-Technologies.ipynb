    "# 🚀 Modernizing LangChain + PDF Loading App with 2025 Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Complete Guide to Building Modern AI-Powered PDF Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook will guide you through the complete modernization of our LangChain + PDF Loading application. We'll explain everything from the ground up - perfect for beginners who want to understand how modern AI applications work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What You'll Learn\n",
    "- How PDF + AI applications work (explained simply!)\n",
    "- What was missing in the original app and how we completed it\n",
    "- Modern 2025 technologies vs older approaches\n",
    "- Vector databases and embeddings (don't worry, we'll make it simple!)\n",
    "- Why these modernizations matter for real applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎊 The Big Achievement\n",
    "**The original app was incomplete!** It had PDF upload but NO way to chat with PDFs. We've created a **complete, modern application** where users can upload PDFs AND ask questions about them using AI."

    "## 🧠 Part 1: Understanding PDF + AI Applications (Beginner-Friendly)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a PDF + AI App?\n",
    "Think of it like having a super-smart assistant that can read any PDF and answer questions about it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You upload a PDF** (like a research paper, manual, or book)\n",
    "2. **The AI reads and understands it** (using something called \"embeddings\")\n",
    "3. **You ask questions** (\"What's the main conclusion?\" or \"Explain section 2\")\n",
    "4. **The AI gives intelligent answers** based on the PDF content\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "📄 User uploads: \"Python Programming Guide.pdf\"\n",
    "💬 User asks: \"How do I create a function in Python?\"\n",
    "🤖 AI answers: \"Based on your PDF, to create a function in Python, you use the 'def' keyword followed by the function name...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Magic Behind It: Vector Embeddings\n",
    "**Simple explanation**: The AI converts PDF text into \"mathematical fingerprints\" called embeddings. When you ask a question, it finds the parts of the PDF with similar \"fingerprints\" and uses that to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like**: A librarian who has read every book and can instantly find the right paragraph to answer your question!"

    "## 🧠 Part 4: Modern LangChain - From Experimental to Stable\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LangChain?\n",
    "LangChain is like a \"Swiss Army knife\" for AI applications. It helps you:\n",
    "- Connect to AI models (like OpenAI's GPT)\n",
    "- Process documents (like PDFs)\n",
    "- Create intelligent question-answering systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Evolution: Unstable → Stable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Old LangChain (Problematic)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Old way - often broke between versions\n",
    "from langchain import OpenAI  # ❌ Deprecated\n",
    "from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings  # ❌ Moved\n",
    "from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS  # ❌ Changed location\n",
    "\n",
    "# This code might stop working after updates!\n",
    "llm = OpenAI()  # ❌ Old API\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modern LangChain (Stable)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# New way - stable and reliable\n",
    "from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI  # ✅ Modern\n",
    "from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings  # ✅ Stable location\n",
    "from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS  # ✅ Organized\n",
    "\n",
    "# This code is future-proof!\n",
    "llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature=0)  # ✅ New API\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "**New way**: \"My app works reliably with stable APIs!\" 😊"

    "## 📄 Part 5: How PDF Q&A Actually Works (The Magic Explained)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Process\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. PDF Upload & Processing\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load the PDF\n",
    "loader = PyPDFLoader(\"your-document.pdf\")\n",
    "document = loader.load()\n",
    "```\n",
    "**What happens**: Extract all text from the PDF\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Text Chunking\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Break into smaller pieces\n",
    "text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\n",
    "    chunk_size=3000,  # About 1 page\n",
    "    chunk_overlap=400  # Some overlap for context\n",
    ")\n",
    "chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(document)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why**: AI works better with smaller pieces of text\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Create Embeddings (The Magic Part!)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Convert text to \"mathematical fingerprints\"\n",
    "embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n",
    "vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**What this does**: Each chunk gets a unique \"mathematical fingerprint\" that captures its meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Question Answering\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# When user asks a question:\n",
    "question = \"What are the main points?\"\n",
    "# 1. Find chunks with similar \"fingerprints\"\n",
    "# 2. Send relevant chunks + question to AI\n",
    "# 3. AI generates answer based on PDF content\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "📄 PDF contains: \"Python is a programming language...\"\n",
    "❓ User asks: \"What is Python?\"\n",
    "🔍 System finds: Chunks about Python programming\n",
    "🤖 AI answers: \"Based on your document, Python is a programming language...\"\n",
