    "* It is a very powerful option.\n",
    "* It has the ingredients to become the dominant Coding Assistant, but we think it probably will evolve to be more user-friendly. It is still in a very early stage.\n",
    "* We personally do not like to use it in the terminal by itself, out of a code editor.\n",
    "* We prefer to use it in combination with Cursor. This is an expensive option, but if it makes (cost/value) sense for you it is the best alternative today in our opinion. We will tell you why we choose this combination and how we use it."
