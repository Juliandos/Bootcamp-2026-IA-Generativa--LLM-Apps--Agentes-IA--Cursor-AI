    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "A few years ago, tools like GitHub Copilot became popular. They could finish your code sentences, much like predictive text on your phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then came coding **AI agents**. Instead of just autocompleting, agents can **plan tasks, write code, test it, and even fix their own mistakes**. This was a big change. Suddenly, AI wasn’t just a helper in the background —it could take on real responsibilities in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“The way that we build software is going to change.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AI is no longer just autocomplete.** Tools like Cursor give you access to intelligent agents that can take on parts of the coding process.\n",
    "* **Humans are still in charge.** Even when AI writes code, you need to review it, understand it, and guide it.\n",
    "* **The workflow is evolving.** Software development is moving toward collaboration between humans and AI—making coding faster, but also requiring you to think critically about what AI produces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Lesson for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning AI-powered coding now puts you at the frontier of modern software development. For beginners, this means you should **embrace AI as a coding partner**—but also keep practicing your own skills so you can guide, review, and understand what the AI creates."

    "\n",
    "Before writing a single line of code, it is essential to understand the importance of **planning**. Even with AI agents at your side, you can’t just “wing it” if you want a real app to work. You need to learn how to go from an idea to a structured plan with the help of AI inside Cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The App Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, have a clear definition of what you want to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, your project will cover all the important parts of a modern web app:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **frontend** (what users see and interact with).\n",
    "* A **backend** (logic and database).\n",
    "* **Authentication** (logging in).\n",
    "* **API integration** (connecting to music services).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing the Technical Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s where AI comes in. Instead of opening a blank file and trying to think of every detail, you will write a **prompt in Cursor** asking the AI to generate a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan must cover things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tech stack choices**: For example, React for the frontend, Tailwind for styling, ShadCN for components, a database (e.g. Postgres), and authentication.\n",
    "* **Infrastructure**: testing setup, git for version control, commit strategy.\n",
    "* **Success criteria**: what “done” means for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI doesn’t just suggest tools, it lays out a roadmap of tasks to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Asking Questions, Not Just Accepting\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand this crucial point: **don’t blindly accept what the AI suggests.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the AI says, *“Use Postgres as the database”*, a beginner might just nod without understanding why. But you will need to stop and ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *“What is Postgres?”*\n",
    "* *“Is it the right choice here?”*\n",
    "* *“What alternatives are there?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "By questioning the plan, you not only learn but also make sure the app fits your actual needs. Remember, other AI tools like ChatGPT can help you with these answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Planning Matters with AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a plan, AI might happily generate lots of code—but you risk ending up with a **messy project** that’s hard to maintain. A clear plan keeps both you and the AI aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to use AI is to **collaborate with it**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let AI suggest the structure.\n",
    "* Review and adjust based on your own understanding.\n",
    "* Keep refining until the plan feels right.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Lesson for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting a project with AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Begin with an idea.** Even a simple app idea is enough.\n",
    "2. **Write a structured prompt.** Ask AI to create a plan, not just code.\n",
    "3. **Stay curious.** Always ask questions about the AI’s choices.\n",
    "4. **Use the plan as your guide.** It will make the coding phase smoother and more meaningful.\n"

    "## Working with Cursor: Prompting, To-Do Lists, Plan Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the plan is written, the next step is to **make it actionable**. This is where Cursor really shines. You can use prompts inside Cursor not just to generate code, but to **organize your entire workflow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starting with a Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "In Cursor, you don’t only write code, you can also write **instructions for AI**. Start with a **README-style prompt** that tells Cursor:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What the project is.\n",
    "* What features it should include.\n",
    "* What tools and frameworks it should use.\n",
    "* What the success criteria are.\n",

    "Check off items in the plan as we accomplish them as a todo list. If you have open questions that require my input, add those in the plan as well.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pay attention to the last paragraph of the README file**, where we ask the AI to ask open questions if he needs more information from us about our initial plan.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Attach the initial README file to the Cursor Chat and ask Cursor to propose a detailed plan to achieve your goals\n",
    "* Prompt: \"Make my plan\"\n",
    "* Your README file will be like the global plan.\n",
    "* The to-do list generated by Cursor will be like the local plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AI Creates a To-Do List\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of jumping into random coding tasks, Cursor responds by building a **to-do list** for the project. This list includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Setting up the project structure.\n",
    "* Installing dependencies.\n",
    "* Adding authentication.\n",
    "* Creating basic pages (e.g., settings page, home page).\n",
    "* Setting up tests and version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a beginner, this is a huge help: you immediately see the roadmap of what needs to be done, step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterating with Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The to-do list is **not final**. It’s just the starting point for a conversation with the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the AI suggests “sync data every minute,” you can ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *“Wouldn’t syncing once per day be enough?”*\n",
    "* *“What happens if a user wants to do X?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "By asking these questions, you refine the plan until it feels realistic and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Human-in-the-Loop Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "AI is smart, but it doesn’t know your exact goals or constraints. That’s why you need to understand the importance of **staying in the loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Treat Cursor like a junior developer: it can propose ideas, but you need to guide it.\n",
    "* Don’t hesitate to adjust the to-do list to match what *you* think makes sense.\n",
    "* Use iteration to make the plan better with each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters for Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "Without guidance, AI might overcomplicate things or make assumptions you don’t understand. By working iteratively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AI proposes a plan.**\n",
    "2. **You review and ask questions.**\n",
    "3. **Together you refine it into a practical roadmap.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how you make sure the project stays both **achievable** and **educational**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Lesson for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with AI in Cursor:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always start with a clear, structured prompt.\n",
    "* Let the AI create a to-do list.\n",
    "* Refine the list by asking “why” and “how” questions.\n",

    "## Foreground vs. Background Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents in Cursor don’t all behave the same way. There are **two main modes** you can use: **foreground agents** and **background agents**. Understanding the difference will help you know when to stay actively involved and when to let AI run on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Foreground Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreground agents are the ones you **interact with directly**. You’re in control, guiding them step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You ask AI to generate a new page in your app.\n",
    "* The agent suggests some code.\n",
    "* You review it, give feedback, and maybe request changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like **pair programming**: you and AI sit together, coding side by side. You see everything it does and can immediately correct mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When building something new.\n",
    "* When you’re unsure about the right approach.\n",
    "* When you want to learn by watching what AI creates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Background agents are a new advanced feature in Cursor. They work **autonomously**, often without you watching them step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can set up a background agent through Slack. If a teammate says, *“Fix the typo on the homepage”*, the agent can go ahead and make the fix automatically—without interrupting your flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background agents are useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Running routine tasks (like syncing data).\n",
    "* Fixing small, obvious bugs.\n",
    "* Handling things you don’t want to stop and do manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use them:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* For repetitive or low-risk tasks.\n",
    "* When you want work done in parallel without distraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules and Memory in Cursor\n",
    "\n",
    "Cursor lets you add **rules and memory** to make agents more effective:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rules**: boundaries for what agents should or shouldn’t do.\n",
    "* **Memory**: context that persists across tasks, so the agent remembers your preferences and project setup. Careful with this, since it takes context space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes agents smarter and safer, while still keeping you in control.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters for Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s tempting to hand everything to AI, but it is important to keep the right balance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **foreground agents** when learning and making important decisions.\n",
    "* Use **background agents** to save time on repetitive work.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining both, you get speed without losing oversight.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Lesson for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of AI agents like teammates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some work *with* you in real time (foreground).\n",
    "* Others quietly handle chores in the background.\n",
    "* You decide when to supervise closely and when to delegate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering this balance will make you both **faster** and **more confident** in using AI for real projects."

    "## Reviewing & Running Generated Code\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting up the plan and organizing tasks, you will actually **let Cursor generate code**. This is the moment when ideas and plans turn into something you can see and run. But there’s a crucial point: **AI writes the code, you review it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The First Scaffolding\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the first tasks, Cursor quickly creates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A basic **project structure**.\n",
    "* A simple **UI scaffold** (like a “Hello World” page).\n",
    "* Pages such as a **settings page**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use modern tools like **ShadCN UI** to build clean, styled components right away. For a beginner, this feels almost magical—AI sets up in seconds what might otherwise take hours of manual work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supervised Cursor vs. Unsupervised Cursor\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you enable the Auto-Run mode in the Settings > Chat, Cursor will not ask for authorization to make changes. Be very careful with this, this mode is faster and more comfortable, but also more risky if you do not know what Cursor is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Importance of Code Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though AI saves time, you should **never skip reviewing the generated code**. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "* AI might make mistakes or misinterpret requirements.\n",
    "* Some code could be too complex or unnecessary for your needs.\n",
    "* Reviewing helps you **learn**: you see how the app is structured and why certain tools are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of AI as a junior developer: it can move fast, but you need to check its work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You can ask Cursor to explain the project scaffold it is proposing\n",
    "* Open a second chat Tab with Command+T and enter a prompt like: \"explain what are the files and folders you have created in the root of the project and why they are necessary.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Leveraging Design Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **design systems** (like ShadCN UI) makes AI output better. Instead of messy or inconsistent styles, you get **ready-made components** (buttons, forms, layouts) that look professional from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "For beginners, this is a huge advantage:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Less time spent fiddling with CSS.\n",
    "* More time focusing on how the app works.\n",
    "* Easier to understand how UI components fit together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running the App\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the scaffold is ready, you can **run the app locally**. Seeing it in the browser—clicking on pages and testing functionality—gives immediate feedback on whether things work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If something doesn’t work, this is where AI plus **tests and error messages** help fix issues quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters for Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is exciting because it shows the real payoff of using Cursor:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You get from **idea → working app** very fast.\n",
    "* You can **see results immediately**, which keeps motivation high.\n",
    "* You learn by reviewing code and connecting it to what shows up in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it also teaches responsibility: **don’t just trust AI blindly—always review and understand what it generates.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Lesson for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Cursor:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let AI scaffold your app.\n",
    "2. Review everything it writes—line by line if possible.\n",
    "3. Take advantage of design systems for cleaner output.\n",
    "4. Run the app early and often to see progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you’re not just watching AI code—you’re actively learning and improving your skills."

    "## Role of Tests, Linters & Type Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "AI can generate a lot of code very quickly. But how do you know if that code is actually correct, safe, and maintainable? Tools like **tests, linters, and type systems** are not just “best practices”, they’re essential for making AI development work smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why These Tools Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, developers use tests and linters to catch mistakes before shipping code. With AI in the mix, they become even more important because they create a **feedback loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AI writes some code.\n",
    "2. The code is run through tests, type checkers, or linters.\n",
    "3. Errors are detected.\n",
    "4. AI can use those errors as signals to fix its own mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of you manually debugging everything, **these tools give the AI structured feedback it can actually learn from**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different levels of testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unit tests**: check if small pieces of code (like a function) work correctly.\n",
    "* **Integration tests**: check if different parts of the system work together.\n",
    "* **End-to-end tests**: check if the user experience works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "With tests in place, AI can run them automatically and see where things fail—then propose fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linters\n",
    "\n",
    "A **linter** is a tool that checks code style and consistency. For example, it might warn if you forgot a semicolon or if your variable names aren’t clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially useful with AI, because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It enforces coding standards across all AI-generated code.\n",
    "* It prevents small style mistakes from piling up.\n",
    "* It gives the AI another source of feedback for corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand the role of Type Systems like **TypeScript** (a typed superset of JavaScript). Types make the code more predictable by defining what kind of data a variable or function should use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a function expects a number but AI tries to pass a string, TypeScript will throw an error.\n",
    "* AI can then use that error message to fix the code automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, type systems keep the AI “on track” and reduce the chance of hidden bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The AI Feedback Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, tests, linters, and types create an environment where AI can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write code.\n",
    "2. See structured feedback (test results, linter errors, type errors).\n",
    "3. Correct itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop makes AI-generated code much more reliable over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters for Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, beginners often skip tests or types to “move faster.” This may be a good idea when you are learning Cursor, or building a demo project. But when you’re working as a pro using AI, these tools actually **make you faster**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They reduce the time you spend debugging.\n",
    "* They improve the quality of AI-generated code.\n",
    "* They help you learn what “good code” looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Lesson for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "When building with AI in Cursor:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Always set up tests.** Even simple ones help a lot.\n",
    "* **Use a linter.** It will keep your code clean and consistent.\n",
    "* **Prefer TypeScript.** The extra safety is worth it, especially with AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of these tools as your safety net. They make both you and the AI more confident in the code you’re writing.\n"

    "## Maintaining Code Quality Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we have shown how AI can quickly scaffold and build features. Let's pause here to talk about something many beginners overlook: **what happens after the first version is done?** Writing code fast is one thing—**keeping it healthy over time** is another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vibe Coding vs. Real Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of **“vibe coding”** is when you spin up a quick prototype just to see if something works. It’s playful, experimental, and often messy.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that’s fine. AI is great at helping you vibe code. You can generate a rough draft of an app quickly and test ideas without worrying too much about structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "But do not forget this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prototypes are disposable.\n",
    "* Real apps need to last.\n",
    "* Long-term maintenance requires discipline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **normal software engineering practices** come back in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Maintenance Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Without structure, your project will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Become harder to understand as it grows.\n",
    "* Collect bugs that are difficult to track down.\n",
    "* Waste time in the long run, even if the prototype was fast to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI doesn’t change this reality. You still need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clear architecture** (how your code is organized).\n",
    "* **Consistent patterns** (so future code fits smoothly).\n",
    "* **Tests and documentation** (to explain what the code is doing).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How AI Can Help With Maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can’t outsource responsibility, AI can help make maintenance less painful:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automating repetitive tasks**: AI can update dependencies, rename variables, or apply formatting rules across a whole project.\n",
    "* **Refactoring code**: AI can reorganize messy functions into cleaner structures.\n",
    "* **Explaining old code**: when you revisit code months later, AI can summarize what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "So while you’re still in charge of quality, AI becomes a handy assistant for the “boring” parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Balanced Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use AI to **prototype fast** (don’t overthink early ideas).\n",
    "* But when a project shows promise, **switch gears** into engineering mode.\n",
    "* Combine AI’s speed with **your judgement** to keep the codebase sustainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters for Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginners often fall in love with the speed of AI coding. It feels amazing to see an app appear in minutes. But remember that **real software lives for months or years**. The sooner you practice maintaining quality, the stronger a developer you’ll become.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Lesson for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prototyping is fun, but temporary.** Don’t mistake it for production-quality work.\n",
    "* **Code quality requires discipline.** AI can help, but can’t replace fundamentals.\n",
    "* **Think long-term.** Every line of code today is something you or someone else may need to understand tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: **AI can boost you, but you still need engineering fundamentals to build something that lasts.**"

    "## Advice for Beginners & Product Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "This is specially for people who are just starting out, as well as those coming from non-technical backgrounds (like product managers). Focus on **curiosity, fundamentals, and learning by doing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learn the Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not rely only on AI without building your own foundation. If the AI suggests using “Postgres” or “OAuth,” you don’t want to just nod and move on: you need to understand what those things are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn the basics of computer science:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loops and conditions.\n",
    "* Data structures (arrays, objects, lists).\n",
    "* How functions work.\n",
    "* The flow of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "These fundamentals act like a safety net. Even when AI generates code, you’ll be able to understand, debug, and improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Build Small Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of waiting until you “know enough,” **jump in and build things**. Even simple projects teach you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to set up and run code.\n",
    "* How different parts (frontend, backend, database) connect.\n",
    "* What questions you should be asking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more you practice, the faster AI suggestions will make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ask Questions (Be Curious)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important habits is to **ask “why” and “how.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "When AI or another developer suggests something, don’t accept it blindly. Instead, ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Why this tool and not another?*\n",
    "* *How does this piece fit into the bigger system?*\n",
    "* *What would happen if we changed it?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This curiosity not only helps you learn, it also makes you better at working with AI, since AI gets stronger when you guide it with clear, thoughtful questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Product Managers and Non-Engineers\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re not a trained engineer, AI can lower the barrier to entry. You don’t need to know everything to get started, you just need enough to ask good questions and try things.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of saying “I can’t code,” try asking Cursor to scaffold a simple page and learn by reviewing it.\n",
    "* Instead of waiting for engineers to answer, experiment with AI and see what you discover.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach makes you more independent and gives you a better understanding of how products are actually built.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Balancing Experimentation and Study\n",
    "\n",
    "Try this mix:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Experimentation (“vibe coding”)**: play around with AI, build small features, learn through trial and error.\n",
    "* **Structured study**: read tutorials, take courses, learn the fundamentals so you understand what you’re doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of the two makes learning both **fun and effective.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters for Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to feel overwhelmed by AI coding—like the tools know more than you. But remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You don’t need to know everything to get started.\n",
    "* Every project teaches you something new.\n",
    "* AI is here to help, but **curiosity and fundamentals** are what make you grow into a real developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Lesson for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Build projects early.** Don’t wait until you feel “ready.”\n",
    "* **Stay curious.** Ask “why” and “how” whenever AI suggests something.\n",
    "* **Mix learning styles.** Use both hands-on coding and structured fundamentals.\n",
    "* **Product background?** Use AI as your entry point, don’t be afraid to experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path to becoming confident with AI coding is not memorizing everything, it’s **learning how to think like a developer while using AI as your partner.**"

    "How does the **Cursor team itself works**? It’s not just about building with AI, it’s about **changing the way teams collaborate and ship products**. Cursor’s culture is lean, flexible, and AI-driven, and it gives us a glimpse of what the future of software development might look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Blending Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, software companies have clear separations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Product managers decide what to build.\n",
    "* Designers handle the visuals.\n",
    "* Engineers write the code.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficiency Through AI and Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example of how the Cursor team saves time:\n",
    "Instead of asking a product manager to handle customer refunds in Stripe, an engineer writes a **small script** with AI’s help. Now, the process is automated.\n",

    "* Faster problem-solving, thanks to AI-powered tooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rapid Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Because AI makes scaffolding and experimenting faster, the team at Cursor can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try out ideas quickly.\n",
    "* Throw away what doesn’t work.\n",
    "* Ship improvements continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn’t about writing perfect code from day one, it’s about moving fast, guided by feedback from users and tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What This Means for You as a Student\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to understand that AI is changing team dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You don’t need to stay “in your lane.” Explore product and design decisions too.\n",
    "* Learn how to use AI to **automate small tasks** that save time.\n",
    "* Don’t be afraid to test ideas quickly, AI gives you that flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even as a beginner, this mindset makes you more valuable: you’re not just someone who “writes code,” but someone who understands how to move a project forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Lesson for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Engineering roles are blending.** Don’t limit yourself to code—think product and design too.\n",
