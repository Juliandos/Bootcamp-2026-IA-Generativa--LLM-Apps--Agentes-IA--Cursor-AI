    "## 🚨 Major Change #1: LangServe is Deprecated\n",
    "\n",
    "### What was LangServe?\n",
    "LangServe was a tool that automatically created REST APIs from LangChain chains. It seemed convenient because you could deploy a chain with just one line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Old approach (2024)\n",
    "from langserve import add_routes\n",
    "add_routes(app, final_chain, path=\"/rag\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it deprecated?\n",
    "As of 2024, LangChain officially recommends **LangGraph Platform** instead of LangServe for new projects. The reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Limited Flexibility**: LangServe was too rigid for real-world applications\n",
    "2. **Performance Issues**: Added unnecessary layers of abstraction\n",
    "3. **Maintenance**: The LangChain team shifted focus to LangGraph\n",
    "4. **Industry Trend**: Direct FastAPI implementations became the standard\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modern Alternative: Direct FastAPI\n",
    "Instead of LangServe, we now use direct FastAPI endpoints, which gives us:\n",
    "- ✅ Full control over API behavior\n",
    "- ✅ Better error handling\n",
    "- ✅ Custom validation\n",
    "- ✅ Streaming responses\n",
    "- ✅ Better documentation"

    "# Old approach\n",

    "# Cost: $0.0001 per 1k tokens\n",

    "# Cost: $0.00002 per 1k tokens (5x cheaper!)\n",
