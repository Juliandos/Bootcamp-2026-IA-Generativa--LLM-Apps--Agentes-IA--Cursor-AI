    "- What Next.js is and why we use it\n",
    "- How to set up a Next.js project\n",
    "- Understanding React fundamentals and JSX\n",

    "## What is Next.js?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next.js** is like a **pre-built foundation for a house**. When you want to build a house, you could start from scratch by digging the foundation, laying pipes, and wiring electricity. Or, you could use a pre-built foundation that already has all the essential infrastructure in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Analogy: Building a Restaurant\n",
    "Imagine you want to open a restaurant:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pure React** = Building everything from scratch: You need to build the kitchen, set up the dining area, create the ordering system, handle payments, manage inventory, etc.\n",
    "- **Next.js** = Renting a space that already has kitchen equipment, dining tables, and basic systems: You can focus on creating your menu (the actual app features) instead of building infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Next.js Provides\n",
    "1. **Routing System**: Automatically creates pages based on file names\n",
    "2. **Performance Optimization**: Makes your website load faster\n",
    "3. **Development Tools**: Hot reloading, error handling, and debugging tools\n",
    "4. **SEO Features**: Better search engine optimization\n",
    "5. **Deployment Ready**: Easy to deploy to platforms like Vercel"

    "## Understanding React Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into Next.js, let's understand **React** - the underlying technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is React?\n",
    "**React** is like **LEGO blocks for websites**. Just like you can build complex structures using simple LEGO pieces, React lets you build complex user interfaces using simple, reusable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key React Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Components\n",
    "Think of components as **custom HTML tags** that you create:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!-- Regular HTML -->\n",
    "<div>Welcome to my website</div>\n",
    "<button>Click me</button>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- React Components -->\n",
    "<WelcomeMessage />\n",
    "<TodoList />\n",
    "<AddTodoButton />\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. JSX (JavaScript XML)\n",
    "JSX is like **HTML inside JavaScript**. It looks like HTML but has the power of JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function WelcomeMessage() {\n",
    "  const name = \"John\";\n",
    "  return <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. State\n",
    "State is like the **memory of your component**. It remembers things that can change:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Like remembering if a light switch is ON or OFF\n",
    "const [isLightOn, setIsLightOn] = useState(false);\n",
    "```"

    "function MyComponent() {\n",
    "  return <div>Hello World!</div>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "function Greeting() {\n",
    "  const name = \"Alice\";\n",
    "  return <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. className Instead of class\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// ❌ Wrong (HTML way)\n",
    "<div class=\"my-style\">Content</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "// ✅ Correct (JSX way)\n",
    "<div className=\"my-style\">Content</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Self-Closing Tags\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// ❌ Wrong\n",
    "<img src=\"image.jpg\">\n",
    "<input type=\"text\">\n",
    "\n",
    "// ✅ Correct\n",
    "<img src=\"image.jpg\" />\n",
    "<input type=\"text\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "function MyComponent() {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <h1>Title</h1>\n",
