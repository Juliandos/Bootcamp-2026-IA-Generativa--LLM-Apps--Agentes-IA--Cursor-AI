    "## Warning: Important Security Concerns\n",
    "The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, which governs how context and state are shared across AI models, brings several **security concerns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Risk**: Sensitive data passed through the protocol (e.g., PII, trade secrets) could be unintentionally exposed to models or systems not authorized to see it.\n",
    "* **Concern**: Inadequate access controls or encryption during context sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unauthorized Context Injection\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Risk**: Attackers could inject malicious or misleading context into the protocol to manipulate model behavior (context poisoning).\n",
    "* **Concern**: Lack of strong integrity checks or authentication for context inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Over-Reliance on Context\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Risk**: Models may rely too heavily on prior context, making them vulnerable to **context-based attacks** (like prompt injections or subtle manipulation of prior state).\n",
    "* **Concern**: Insecure design without context validation mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inconsistent Context Boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Risk**: Poorly defined boundaries between models or sessions could cause context bleeding across users, violating data privacy.\n",
    "* **Concern**: Weak session isolation in multi-user environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logging and Storage Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Risk**: Persistent storage or logging of contextual data could inadvertently capture sensitive information.\n",
    "* **Concern**: Lack of encryption, retention policies, or data minimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Replay Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Risk**: Captured context data could be resent to models to reproduce or trigger unintended outputs.\n",
    "* **Concern**: No timestamping or session-bound encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inference Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Risk**: Adversaries could craft queries to infer sensitive context that the model has access to.\n",
    "* **Concern**: Models trained or configured without defenses against **membership inference** or **model inversion attacks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ways to Mitigate this Security Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encryption (in transit & at rest)** of all context data.\n",
    "* **Strict access controls** and **authentication** on context handling APIs.\n",
    "* **Context integrity checks** using signatures or hashing.\n",
    "* **Session isolation** and **context expiration** policies.\n",
    "* **Auditing and monitoring** for anomalous context changes."

    "## Our advice\n",
    "MCP is still in a very early-stage. For advanced students, we recommend to experiment with it with caution. Pay attention to these **practical guidelines** to balance learning with security awareness:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Start with Non-Sensitive Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advice**: Only use **public or dummy data** when passing context via MCP.\n",
    "* **Why**: Avoid accidental leakage of personal, confidential, or proprietary information while learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understand Context Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advice**: Learn and define the **scope of the context** you are passing (e.g., session-based, user-specific).\n",
    "* **Why**: Prevent accidental context mixing between users or sessions in experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Basic Access Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advice**: If building apps or APIs with MCP, **limit access** to trusted users only and **authenticate interactions**.\n",
    "* **Why**: This reduces the risk of unauthorized context injection or tampering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sanitize Context Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advice**: Implement **input validation and sanitization** before feeding context into a model.\n",
    "* **Why**: Helps defend against **prompt injection** and malicious payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Monitor and Log Carefully\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advice**: Enable logging for debugging but ensure **logs do not store sensitive context**.\n",
    "* **Why**: Beginners often overlook that logs can unintentionally become a liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Session Isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advice**: Design experiments where each test or user interaction has its **own isolated context**.\n",
    "* **Why**: Prevents context leakage and simplifies debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learn Basic Encryption Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advice**: Explore the basics of **encryption for data in transit** (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) when sharing context between services.\n",
    "* **Why**: It’s a foundational security skill for any data pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflect on Context Expiration\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advice**: Set **clear rules for context lifetime** (e.g., auto-expire after session ends).\n",
    "* **Why**: Reduces long-term risks if context is mishandled.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Note\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advice**: Always ask: *\"What if this data gets exposed? Would it harm anyone?\"*\n",
    "* **Why**: This mindset fosters responsible experimentation."
