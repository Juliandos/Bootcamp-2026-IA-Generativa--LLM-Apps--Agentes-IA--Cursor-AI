    "- Lots of boilerplate code\n",
    "- Hard to manage different prompts\n",
    "- Complex error handling\n",
    "- Difficult to switch between AI providers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: LangChain (Simpler and More Powerful)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# LangChain - clean and organized\n",
    "from langchain import OpenAI, PromptTemplate\n",
    "from langchain.chains import LLMChain\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up once\n",

    "**Benefits of LangChain:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Clean code**: Less boilerplate, more readable\n",
    "- ✅ **Template management**: Organize your prompts easily\n",
    "- ✅ **Chain multiple operations**: Combine AI tasks\n",
    "- ✅ **Provider flexibility**: Switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.\n",
    "- ✅ **Built-in error handling**: Robust by default\n",
    "- ✅ **Memory management**: Handle conversation context\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangChain Core Concepts (Simple Explanation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**🤖 LLM (Large Language Model)**\n",
    "- The AI brain (OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, etc.)\n",
    "- Think of it as the \"engine\" that generates text\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 PromptTemplate**\n",
    "- A reusable template for your AI instructions\n",
    "- Like a form with blanks to fill in: \"Write a {style} about {topic}\"\n",

    "## Part 5: The Two AI Features We're Building\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature 1: Text Summarization Endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "- Takes any text as input\n",
    "- Returns a concise summary using AI\n",
    "- Independent of todo data (general purpose)\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Design:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "POST /todos/summarize-text\n",
    "Body: \"Long text that needs summarization...\"\n",
    "Response: {\"summary\": \"Brief summary of the text\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Summarize meeting notes you paste into todos\n",
    "- Condense long task descriptions\n",
    "- General text processing for any purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangChain Implementation Pattern:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Template for consistent summarization\n",
    "summarize_prompt = PromptTemplate(\n",
    "    template=\"Provide a summary for the following text: {text}\",\n",
    "    input_variables=['text']\n",

    "\n",
    "# Chain that can be reused\n",
    "summarize_chain = LLMChain(llm=openai_llm, prompt=summarize_prompt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature 2: AI Poem Generator for Todos\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "- Takes a specific todo item by ID\n",
    "- Generates a creative poem based on that todo's content\n",
    "- Integrates with your existing todo data\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Design:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "POST /todos/write-poem/{todo_id}\n",
    "Response: {\"poem\": \"Creative poem based on todo content\"}\n",
    "```\n",

    "- \"Generate Poem\" button next to each todo\n",
    "- Click button → API call → Display poem in popup\n",
    "- Close button to dismiss the poem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Feature is Great for Learning:**\n",
    "1. **Combines existing data with AI**: Uses your todo content creatively\n",
    "2. **Practical UI patterns**: Popup/modal display for AI results\n",
    "3. **User engagement**: Makes mundane todos more fun and motivating\n",
    "4. **Error handling**: Good practice for managing AI API failures\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Integration Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 Our Development Plan:**\n",
    "1. **Notebook 22**: Backend AI integration (LangChain + FastAPI)\n",
    "2. **Notebook 23**: Frontend AI features (React components + UI)\n",
    "3. **Testing**: Verify both features work without breaking existing functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔧 Key Principles We'll Follow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Safety First**\n",
    "- Keep existing todo functionality working\n",
    "- Add AI features as enhancements, not replacements\n",
    "- Handle AI API failures gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Clean Code**\n",
    "- Separate AI logic from CRUD logic\n",
    "- Use LangChain patterns for organized code\n",
    "- Clear error messages for users\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. User Experience**\n",
    "- Loading states for AI operations (they can take 2-3 seconds)\n",
    "- Clear visual feedback for AI features\n",
    "- Fallback behavior when AI is unavailable\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Cost Awareness**\n",
    "- Reasonable API usage patterns\n",
    "- No accidental infinite loops calling AI\n",
    "- User control over AI feature usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧪 How We'll Verify Each Step:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backend Testing:**\n",
    "- Use FastAPI's automatic docs (`http://localhost:8000/docs`)\n",
    "- Test AI endpoints directly before frontend integration\n",
    "- Verify existing CRUD endpoints still work\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frontend Testing:**\n",
    "- Test AI features in browser\n",
    "- Verify existing todo functionality unchanged\n",
    "- Test error scenarios (API key missing, network issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integration Testing:**\n",
    "- Create todos → Generate poems → Verify results\n",
    "- Test with various todo content (short, long, special characters)\n",
    "- Performance testing (AI calls can be slower than CRUD)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚨 What Can Go Wrong with AI Integration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**API-Related Issues:**\n",
    "- Missing or invalid OpenAI API key\n",
    "- Network connectivity problems\n",
    "- OpenAI API rate limits or quota exceeded\n",
    "- AI model temporary unavailability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content-Related Issues:**\n",
    "- Empty or very short todo content\n",
    "- Special characters or non-English text\n",
    "- Very long todo descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**🛡️ Our Error Handling Approach:**\n",
    "- **Graceful degradation**: App works even if AI fails\n",
    "- **User-friendly messages**: Clear explanations, not technical errors\n",
    "- **Retry mechanisms**: Some AI failures are temporary\n",
    "- **Fallback content**: Default responses when AI unavailable"
