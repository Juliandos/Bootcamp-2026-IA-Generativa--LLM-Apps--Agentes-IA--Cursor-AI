    "## Composer and Chat are now integrated. Understand the new Chat modes: Agent vs Ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're just starting out with **Cursor**, you may have seen two options when opening a new chat: **Agent** and **Ask**. These are two distinct \"modes\" for interacting with the AI assistant inside Cursor—and understanding the difference between them will help you work much faster and smarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break it down in simple terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Bit of History: What Were “Composer” and “Chat”?\n",
    "\n",
    "In older versions of Cursor (like 0.45), the AI tools were split into two separate features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Composer**: A dedicated panel where you could write instructions like “Refactor this function” or “Add error handling,” and the AI would *edit* your code for you. It was like giving instructions to a robot that knew how to code.\n",
    "* **Chat**: A more casual conversation interface. You could ask questions like “What does this file do?” or “How do I use Axios?”—but it wouldn’t change your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In those early days, the separation between **editing** and **asking** was very clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Changed?\n",
    "\n",
    "As Cursor evolved—especially in versions 1.0 and later—the team **merged and streamlined** these features. Instead of two separate places for Chat and Composer, everything is now unified in the **Chat window**, with two selectable **modes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Agent Mode`\n",
    "* `Ask Mode`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent Mode: Your AI Developer Sidekick\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Mode is like having an AI coworker that can **do the coding for you**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can **edit** your files\n",
    "* **Create new files**\n",
    "* **Run commands in your terminal**\n",
    "* **Apply changes across multiple files**\n",
    "* All while understanding your whole codebase\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Use It:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Highlight a piece of code, or just open Chat with `Cmd+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select **Agent Mode** (it's selected by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Give it an instruction:\n",
    "\n",
    "   > “Convert this function to async”\n",
    "   > “Add input validation”\n",
    "   > “Build a simple Express server”\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cursor will show you a preview of the code changes. You can approve or reject them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use It:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **Agent Mode** when you want the AI to take action and **actually write or modify code** for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ask Mode: Your Private Tutor\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask Mode is a **read-only** mode. Cursor won’t touch your files, but it can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain what code does\n",
    "* Search your project to find functions or references\n",
    "* Help you understand unfamiliar concepts\n",
    "* Pull in answers from the web or documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Use It:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Chat with `Cmd+I` or `Cmd+L`.\n",
    "2. Switch to **Ask Mode** in the dropdown.\n",
    "3. Ask anything:\n",
    "\n",
    "   > “What does this function return?”\n",
    "   > “Where is `useAuth` defined?”\n",
    "   > “How do I create a dark mode in Tailwind CSS?”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use It:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **Ask Mode** when you're **learning**, **exploring**, or **debugging**—but don’t want to risk changing anything yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary: Which Mode Should I Use?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Goal                               | Use This Mode |\n",
    "| ---------------------------------- | ------------- |\n",
    "| Edit or generate code              | Agent      |\n",
    "| Refactor or fix bugs               | Agent      |\n",
    "| Explore or understand code         | Ask        |\n",
    "| Look up docs or error explanations | Ask        |\n",
    "| Plan before coding                 | Ask        |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Again, where Did Composer Go?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you used the **Composer** feature in Cursor 0.45 or earlier, you may be wondering: “Where did it go?”\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said in the previous section, the answer is **Composer is now inside Agent Mode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functionality you used in Composer (like editing selected code, adding docstrings, or refactoring logic) is still there—it just shows up when you highlight code and open Agent Chat. Instead of opening a separate Composer panel, Cursor now adapts depending on your context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No code selected** → Agent behaves like a project planner.\n",
    "* **Code selected** → Agent behaves like Composer used to, editing only that snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Tip for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t worry about getting it perfect right away. Try both modes and experiment! Think of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agent** as your action buddy—ready to code and fix\n",
    "* **Ask** as your research partner—ready to explain and guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning when to use each will give you superpowers as a developer."

    "## Say Goodbye to `.cursorrules`: Meet the New Cursor Rules Format\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Is `.cursorrules`?\n",
    "\n",
    "In older versions of Cursor, if you wanted to guide the AI (for example, tell it how your code should be styled or what not to touch), you would write your instructions in a special file called:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".cursorrules\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This file lived at the root of your project and gave the AI global instructions. Simple, but limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Changed?\n",
    "\n",
    "In newer versions of Cursor, the team introduced a **more powerful, flexible, and organized system** for writing AI instructions. Now, instead of using `.cursorrules`, you can create a **rules folder** with one or more `.mdc` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what it looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".project-root/\n",
    "  └── .cursor/\n",
    "       └── rules/\n",
    "            ├── naming-style.mdc\n",
    "            ├── test-guidelines.mdc\n",
    "            └── file-structure.mdc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `.mdc` file contains **a specific set of instructions**, and you can **target them to certain files or folders** using patterns called \"globs\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📝 Note: `.mdc` stands for *Markdown + Cursor metadata*. You write your rule in Markdown, and include some metadata at the top to tell Cursor when to apply the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is `.cursorrules` Still Supported?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes — for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.cursorrules` file still works, so if your project already uses it, you don’t need to panic. But it's considered **deprecated**, which means:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You should move to the new `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` format when you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Is the New Format Better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some advantages of using `.mdc` rules:\n",

    "| Better for teams/projects | ❌              | ✅                                |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: A Rule for Python Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what a modern `.mdc` rule file might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "**📄 `.cursor/rules/test-style.mdc`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "---\n",
    "globs: [\"tests/**/*.py\"]\n",
    "name: \"Testing Guidelines\"\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use pytest for all test cases.\n",
    "- Always include at least one assert statement.\n",
    "- Mock external APIs.\n",
    "- Name test functions starting with `test_`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule only applies to `.py` files in the `tests/` folder. Simple and powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Migrate from `.cursorrules`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have a `.cursorrules` file, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Copy** its content into one or more `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/`.\n",
    "2. **Organize** them by topic (e.g., code style, naming, test rules).\n",
    "3. **Add frontmatter** (the part between `---`) to control when each rule is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer, you can also use the **Cursor sidebar** to create new rule files directly from the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pro Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Start small — maybe just move one rule (like code formatting or naming conventions) into a `.mdc` file. Once you get comfortable, you'll never want to go back to the old format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can find good examples of cursor-rule files in places like the [Cursor Directory](https://cursor.directory/) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Cursor’s new rule system is like giving your AI **clear, focused instructions** for each part of your project. It's more organized, more powerful, and much easier to maintain in teams or growing codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're learning Cursor today, skip the `.cursorrules` file and go straight to `.mdc` rules. You’ll be ahead of the curve."

    "## How to Connect Cursor to MCP Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to using **Cursor** with **MCP servers**, you're about to unlock one of its most powerful features — the ability to connect external tools and APIs directly into your AI-assisted coding workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through how to find, select, and connect to these tools using the [Cursor Directory](https://cursor.directory), even if you’re just getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What’s an MCP Server?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP** stands for **Model Context Protocol**. Think of an MCP server as a bridge between Cursor and your favorite tools — like APIs, CLIs, or even custom scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "With MCP, you can do things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interact with external services (e.g., Render, Mailtrap, Postmark)\n",
    "* Run terminal commands from Cursor’s chat interface\n",
    "* Automate repetitive dev tasks using AI + tools\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Visit the Cursor Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Head to [https://cursor.directory](https://cursor.directory) — this is the official place where Cursor showcases a curated list of available MCP servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scroll down to the **“Featured MCPs”** section.\n",
    "* Click on **“View all”** to explore more options.\n",
    "* Select any MCP server you want to learn about (e.g., **Render**, **Postman**, or **Browserbase**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each server has its own page with a description and instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Follow the Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each MCP server page shows you how to connect it to your Cursor app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions usually look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open Cursor Settings**: Use the shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + J`.\n",
    "2. **Go to Features → MCP** in the settings sidebar.\n",
    "3. Click **“+ Add New MCP Server”**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open a setup form inside Cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Fill in the Server Details\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll now be prompted to fill out:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Name** – Give your MCP server a friendly name.\n",
    "* **Transport Type** – Choose between:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `stdio` (for local scripts)\n",
    "  * `SSE` (for remote servers)\n",
    "* **Command or URL** – Depending on the type:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If `stdio`: enter the command to start the server locally (e.g., `python server.py`)\n",
    "  * If `SSE`: enter the server’s public endpoint (e.g., `https://mcp.example.com/sse`)\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are often provided directly on the Cursor Directory page for that tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Save and Activate\n",
    "\n",
    "Once added:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The server will appear in your **MCP settings** panel in Cursor.\n",
    "* Cursor will auto-detect available tools exposed by that MCP.\n",
    "* You can now **use those tools directly from the AI chat window** (aka Composer).\n",
    "\n",
    "💬 Try typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "What tools do you have available?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Cursor will list the tools it discovered from the MCP server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pro Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* If nothing shows up, double-check that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Your server is running (for local `stdio` tools).\n",
    "  * The URL is correct (for `SSE`).\n",
    "  * The tool uses proper MCP conventions (input/output JSON).\n",
    "* You can **define MCP servers globally** by editing a file:\n",
    "  `~/.cursor/mcp.json`\n",
    "* Or **project-specific**:\n",
    "  `.cursor/mcp.json` in your workspace folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Adding a Remote MCP Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you're adding an SSE-based server:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [cursor.directory](https://cursor.directory) and pick **Render**.\n",
    "2. Click “Add New MCP Server” in Cursor.\n",
    "3. Fill in:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Name**: `Render`\n",
    "   * **Transport**: `SSE`\n",
    "   * **URL**: `https://mcp-render.yourdomain.com/sse` (example)\n",
    "4. Save and go!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Deploy my app using the Render tool.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting MCP servers to Cursor opens up a world of automation, context-awareness, and AI-powered workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to this, just remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use [https://cursor.directory](https://cursor.directory) to browse tools.\n",
    "* Follow the setup instructions inside each tool page.\n",
    "* Use Cursor’s built-in MCP settings to connect — no code required."
