    "## About Kimi K2\n",
    "Here’s the lowdown on **Kimi K2**, the freshly released AI model from China’s Moonshot AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Kimi K2?\n",
    "Kimi K2 is a game-changer—blending high-end AI capabilities with a transparent, developer-first, and cost-efficient model. If you’re working on code bots, automation pipelines, or large-document analysis and want to avoid proprietary lock-in, it’s definitely worth exploring.\n",
    "* Seen as the **“next DeepSeek moment”**, marking China's arrival as a powerhouse in open-source agentic AI.\n",
    "* Offers **state-of-the-art performance** while being **transparent, open, and budget-friendly**—a major shift from proprietary AI dominance.\n",
    "* **Mixture‑of‑Experts architecture**: A massive 1 trillion‑parameter model, but only **\\~32 billion parameters activate per inference** from a pool of 384 experts.\n",
    "* **Massive context window**: Handles sequences up to **128 K tokens**, ideal for large documents or codebases.\n",
    "* **Agentic capabilities**: Trained not just for chat but also to **use tools, run code, interact with APIs and shells**, execute multi‑step workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Architecture & Training\n",
    "* **MuOnClip optimizer** (an improved version of Muon): prevents instability (like exploding attention logits) during scale‑up training—enabling training on **15.5 trillion tokens** with “zero training spikes”.\n",
    "* **61 transformer layers**, attention heads reduced to optimize memory and enable deeper contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Benchmarks\n",
    "* **Coding Tests**: LiveCodeBench Pass\\@1: **53.7%**, OJBench: **27.1%**, significantly surpassing GPT‑4.1 (\\~44.7%) and other open models.\n",
    "* **Knowledge & reasoning**: Strong results in MMLU (\\~89.5%), near to GPT‑4.1 (\\~90.4%) and Claude 4 (\\~92.9%).\n",
    "* **Agentic tasks**: Excels in tool‑use and multi‑step tasks; ranked at the top in benchmarks like AceBench, Tau2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open & Affordable\n",
    "* **Open-source** under Apache 2.0: weights are available on GitHub and Hugging Face.\n",
    "* **API pricing** (via OpenRouter etc.): roughly **\\$0.14–0.15 per million input tokens**, **\\$2.49–2.50 per million output tokens**—often **< 1/3 the cost** of GPT‑4.1/Claude4.\n",
    "* **Free tiers** available for experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases & Integration\n",
    "* Good for **code generation, debugging, and large‑scale document analysis**, thanks to its token capacity and agentic workflows.\n",
    "* Compatible with frameworks like **vLLM**, **TensorRT‑LLM**, and accessible through **OpenRouter**, **SiliconFlow**, and others.\n",
    "* Users report success in **building UIs, games, pipeline automation**, and even **splitting tasks between K2 and deeper reasoners** for efficient workflows.\n",

    "## How can you use it with LangChain\n",
    "You can integrate **Kimi K2** with **LangChain** using its OpenAI-compatible API — here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Up Kimi K2 with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Get API Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Register on **Moonshot AI** or **OpenRouter**, then copy your API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configure LangChain Client**\n",
    "   Use the OpenAI-compatible interface to point LangChain to Kimi K2. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "client = ChatOpenAI(\n",
    "    openai_api_base=\"https://platform.moonshot.ai/anthropic\",\n",
    "    openai_api_key=\"YOUR_KIMI_API_KEY\",\n",
    "    model=\"kimi-k2-instruct\",            # or use \"kimi-k2-base\"\n",
    "    temperature=0.6\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Moonshot’s API supports both **OpenAI-style** and **Anthropic-style** endpoints.\n",
    "* Temperatures around **0.6** are recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases & Functionality\n",
    "* **Chat and Completion** – Works like any `ChatOpenAI` model in LangChain, supporting `client.chat` for messages.\n",
    "* **Tool-Enabled Agents** – Kimi K2 supports rich agentic workflows; pass tool schemas to LangChain’s agent builders (e.g. `initialize_agent`) to enable function calling.\n",
    "* **Large Contexts** – Handles up to **128 000 tokens** – perfect for lengthy documents or codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Creating a LangChain Agent with Kimi K2\n",
    "Here's a quick snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\n",
    "from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_weather(city: str) -> str:\n",
    "    return \"Sunny\"\n",
    "\n",
    "weather_tool = Tool(\n",
    "    name=\"get_weather\",\n",
    "    func=get_weather,\n",
    "    description=\"Get today’s weather for a given city\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "client = ChatOpenAI(\n",
    "    openai_api_base=\"https://platform.moonshot.ai/anthropic\",\n",
    "    openai_api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n",
    "    model=\"kimi-k2-instruct\",\n",
    "    temperature=0.6\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "agent = initialize_agent(\n",
    "    tools=[weather_tool],\n",
    "    llm=client,\n",
    "    agent_type=\"openai-functions\",\n",
    "    verbose=True\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "agent.run(\"What’s the weather in Beijing? Use the tool if needed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets the model decide when to call `get_weather` using LangChain’s function-calling mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step                       | Description                                                 |\n",
    "| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **1. Obtain API key**      | From Moonshot or OpenRouter                                 |\n",
    "| **2. Configure LangChain** | Use OpenAI-compatible settings                              |\n",
    "| **3. Define tools**        | As LangChain `Tool` objects                                 |\n",
    "| **4. Build agent**         | With `initialize_agent(..., agent_type=\"openai-functions\")` |\n",
    "| **5. Run interactively**   | The model handles tool calls and auto-generation            |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why It Works Well\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Seamless compatibility** — Moonshot’s endpoints directly plug into existing LangChain workflows.\n",
    "* **Strong agentic abilities** — Kimi K2 is designed to reason and operate tools effectively.\n",
    "* **Huge context support** — Ideal for complex, multi-step tasks with long prompt chains."
