    "### Why Poetry Over pip?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of dependency management like organizing your toolbox:\n",
    "- **Old way (pip)**: Throwing all tools in a box with a list written on paper\n",
    "- **New way (Poetry)**: Organized toolbox with compartments and automatic inventory\n",
    "\n",

    "aiostream==0.5.2\n",
    "annotated-types==0.6.0\n",
    "anyio==3.7.1\n",
    "# ... 181 more lines of dependencies!\n",
    "fastapi==0.104.1\n",
    "openai==1.3.5\n",
    "# Problems:\n",
    "# - Hard to understand what you actually need\n",
    "# - Dependency conflicts are common\n",
    "# - No separation of dev vs production deps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### New Approach: pyproject.toml (Clean & Clear!)\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "[tool.poetry.dependencies]\n",

    "    description: description\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits for Beginners:\n",
    "1. **Catch bugs early** - Before your users see them!\n",
    "2. **Better autocomplete** - Your editor suggests the right properties\n",
    "3. **Self-documenting code** - Types tell you what functions expect\n",
